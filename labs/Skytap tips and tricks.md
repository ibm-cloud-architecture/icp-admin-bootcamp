Use the Tab key to get to fields that you otherwise cannot see.   If the lab indicates there should be a button or fiels that you need to do something with and you can't see it, try hitting tab a few times to get to it.


## Starting up Skytap<a name="startskytap"></a>
1. Open a browser on your lab machine (Chrome offers the best performance, next option IE)
2. Enter the URL for your Skytap environment. You will obtain this from your instructor.
3. You should see a panel with all eight VMs listed. All the VMs should be in a stopped state.
4. Click the large Start button (not the Start button on the individual VMs).
5. The VMs will spin for awhile.  Be patient and wait for each VM to show a started state.

## Copy and paste inside of Skytap<a name="fullscreenmode"></a>
To copy text from your local system to the Skytap VM highlight the text and chose **Copy** or use the shortcut **Ctrl C** or **Command C** to copy the text.  From within the VM perform a typical paste using the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl V** (the menu option is not fully supported).   Be patient there may be a delay.

To copy text from the Skytap VM to your local system, highlight the text and  use the shortcut **Ctrl C** twice in succession to copy the text.  From within your local system perform the paste as normal using the mentu option **Ctrl V** or **Command V**.

> Additionally there is a VM clipboard tool on the toolbar.  The VM Clipboard tool provides a staging area for copying test between the VM and your local system.  It can hold up to 32KB of plain text.  Also keep in mind **vim** does not use the system clipboard, to paste into **vim** use **Ctrl Shift V**.
